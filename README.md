# Anomaly-detection-using-UNSW-NB15-dataset
**The dataset used is a part of training and testing from this link:
https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2FUNSW-NB15%20-%20CSV%20Files%2Fa%20part%20of%20training%20and%20testing%20set

1. The number of records in the training set is 175,341 records and the testing set is 82,332 records from the different types, attack and normal.
2. EDA of the dataset can be found here.
3. Preprocessing of the dataset can be found here.
4. The final model using Isolation forest can be found here.

More details of the Isolation forest can be found here :

**Why Isolation forest ?**
Isolation Forest isolates the outliers and thus, making it easy to detect.
